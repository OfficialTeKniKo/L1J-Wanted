Bin Data Update Manual

1. Run Live Update Launcher2 to receive all updates

2. Extract desc-k and string-k with the extraction tool and put them in the data folder

3. Sort by date in the Contents folder of the installed client and copy the changed empty files.
Paste into pack folder data\Contents

4. After changing the empty file to be updated to true in common.properties, the update completion message is displayed when the server is started, and then it is completed.

5. Change it back to false after done so it doesn't change again

6. Must be processed one by one in order (because empty data is huge, problems may occur if several are updated at once)
