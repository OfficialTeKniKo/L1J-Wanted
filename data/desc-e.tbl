Is this the "Talking Island"?
I'm pretty sure that's what a Knight from the "House of Red Knight" would say.
There seems to be no doubt in the information that there are those who are plotting to raise the flag against His Majesty here.
But, Your Majesty, you are not too concerned, are you? Even though he is Duke Defil's son, what can he do by himself?...
Watch your language. Do you think that you, as a person like you, can have an opinion on a decision made by His Majesty himself?
And I went too far!
Well, let's go back to the castle for now. I must warn you, don't pull out your sword carelessly on anyone.
Yes, sir!
In the meantime, it would be faster to try to make contact with the island's inhabitants and ransack those who look like them.
...Wouldn't it be better to go and visit Gunther first and ask him?
Do you think Gunther will cooperate with us when he is highly antagonistic to His Majesty?
...How about we just kill everyone who lives on this island, including Gunther? That way, we won't have to worry about it later...
Did I not tell you before to watch your mouth? Whoever spills the blood of an innocent man will be rewarded tenfold.
...The question, again, is whether the person we are looking for is actually making headway here...
...No, just the opposite. It is those who are showing their heads that are the dangerous ones, the ones who are against Your Majesty. Now, be vigilant and watch your surroundings!
Yes, sir!
Report on the search.
Yes, sir! So far, no one is particularly suspicious.
But...the people who live on this island seem to have a general antipathy toward His Majesty.
In fact, we were even almost attacked during the patrol.
We did not find anyone "particularly" suspicious, but on the contrary, all the people on the island are somehow "a little" suspicious.
I see. So we can't let down our guard against this island after all...
All right, that's it for today, we're going home. All clear out!
Yes, sir!
Where did these cheeky things come from...!
...Poor guys....you can't tell at a glance what they're capable of...
Gosh!
...Pfft, killing me is ...... useless.... Reports of traitors here have already reached His Majesty's ears ...... and soon another strike force will come...

The soul oppressed in the picture is filled with wrath and so...
Trying to appease the wrath of the oppressed soul...
Leaving the way of restraint and entering the path of freedom...
The door of oppression will open...
The division between faith and disbelief engulfs the heart and...
The separation between materiality and intangibility sharpens the jaws of death...
The eye of emotion is covered by the eye of reason...
I am the flame that doesn't go out -- and the one that blocks the wind.

Boing... Where is my master?
Bounce, bounce... I've got to be with my master.
Bounce... Do you have a carrot?
Woof! Wait a moment.
Woof! Whew... You're clothes are gonna get dirty.
Woof, woof! I've got to go gracefully.
Woof, woof! I'll stay with you, master...
Whew... I'm tired.
Whew... What do you want?
Whew... Well, are you at least going to give me something to eat?
Whew... I like being with you the most, master.

Lastabad Gatekeeper
Oh... The enemy has invaded! Defend Lastabad to the death!
Aaah... The passageway door has been penetrated! Stop the enemy!
Aayaah... The Evil Power Squad Leader's Room door has been opened but it would be better not to engage in any more reckless challenges.
Ugh... The passageway to the underground has been opened but it won't be safe.
It's true that I killed Dark Fencer but I'm no equal to the Evil Power King.
Get back. You will regret it the moment you go past here.
This is where the Evil Power Army King stays. Your fate ends here!
Hey... If you're so tough, you can go up against the Evil Spirit Army.
Sinclair will definitely deal with you... Aye.
Hee, hee.... Becomes prey of ferocious beasts
My Evil Power ones... Stop these invaders.
Dark Fencer... Show me the strength of the Evil Power Brigade.
Whew.... Are you saying that the Lastabad Evil Power Brigade has collapsed?
My Drake ones... Stop them so they can't attack... Stop them...
You will feel the power of the Evil Magic Troup Leader Carmiel.
The door of the magic laboratory has been opened. Block it before the invaders arrive.
The first door has been opened. Block it!
The second door has been opened. Block it!!
The third door has been opened. Block it!!
I knew the Evil Spirit King's hands would be dirtied...
How vexing... This is all the power that the Evil Spirit Army has?
Stop them! Protect the Lastabad Magic Guide!
Stop them! Protect the Lastabad Scroll!
Hee, hee....
The Evil Spirit Army has collapsed... How could that have happened?!
Wow!
It recognized my existence... How could...?
Whoa!
Whoa!
As long as Bright Magic Squad Leader is there, we won't be able to go any further!
I lost but Lastabad didn't lose.
This is a warning! Destruction will come if you proceed any further!
Block them so they can't go any farther!
This is my last warning! You will be destroyed if you enter here!
Already at a place from which one cannot retreat....
Hahaha. You fools... I, Hellvine, will be revived! Kneel before the new master of Lastabad!
Oh... Mercenary Commander Mephaisto will get revenge!
Ah... Long live Mephaisto!!
I believe in the power of Mephaisto.
.....
Whew.... I will wait for Mephaisto.
You have already lost.
Is this the defeat of Mephaisto? I can't believe it. I can't believe...
We are the loyal Assassin Squad.
Do you want to see the power of Assassin Squad Leader Blaze?
That's an underground prison. It would be better not to go there...
OK... You'll disappear into that deep underground dungeon.
Regardless of where you go, you'll never make it back alive.
Are you going to oppose Palace Guard Commander Kyte?
Get a taste of the trained, select assassins.
A challenge to Assassin Army King Slave means death.
I have met my end in this place....
Oh.... The top assassin of their group defeated me. He's got really surprising ability!
Ariok
Sniff, sniff... I smell a human... Where is it?
Whew.... Treasure... Just that treasure...
Kuman...! Get away....

It gets stronger as it dies.
You will be on your knees at the end of this road.
You're worthless... Do not speculate because the death of insignificant light means the birth of holy darkness...
Are you going to choose the way of the insignificant light? You will regret it.
You're not pure... You cannot deceive my eyes...
I will give you the will of purity...
Follow me, you weakling...
I will engrave the will of the person deep in your heart...
I will fill the body and soul with pure darkness...
Greet him with your head bowed down...
I have to overcome this with my will...
Thank you for ending my pain...
Argh... Don't control me!!
I'm finally going back...

Well, let's start the final check.
If you don't need final check, just press [alt + 2].
Your minimal qualifications will be tested when you enter the dungeon.
It's not a difficult opponent. I believe you can pass easily.
In addition, scaffolding is prepared inside to release and set up traps.
I've tried to make the scaffolding as clear as possible.
Please don't complain about my aesthetics.
And, well, you'll see some interesting things, you'd better hurry so you won't be late.
Be careful! Safety cannot be guaranteed.
It's time to get started.
Hardin: Whew...looks like I barely prevented that. Keep trying harder!
The 4th seal has been broken.[4/12]
Who woke me up I am tired...
The 8th seal has been broken.[8/12]

Hardin's Diary Exchange^Magic Letters
Orim: Calm down, everyone. Listen to me.
Orim: If you do not need an explanation, you may skip it with [ALT+1}
Orim: The person who is attacking the ships is called Aldin.
Orim: Let's talk about the details after you survive.
Orim: The first step is to survive. I will start by explaining how to use the cannon.
Orim: When the fight begins, a red magic circle will appear on the floor. Enter it immediately.
Orim: The party leader should then stand on a platform with the same pattern between the cannons.
Orim: Pressing [ALT+4] in the platform will fire a round from the cannon.
Orim: However, defense is also necessary because the enemy will also attack.
Orim: For defense, please enter the yellow magic circle.
Orim: If you press [ALT+2] in the yellow circle, I will chant a defensive spell.
Orim: Now, prepare for the enemy attack. Hurry!
Orim: There are schools of sharks around. Watch out!
Orim: There seems to be a sea harpy habitat right next to it. Watch out!
Orim: Seedlake. Don't get too close just because it's rare!
Orim: That creepy one looks somewhat dangerous.
Orim: We do not have much time. Please hurry.
Orim: We seem to have let the enemy get away. ......
Orim: There is nothing we can do with this force. Everyone must flee.
Orim: There seems to be something floating around here. Please be careful.
Orim: Ugh! Even marine life is attacking us. Why at a time like this!
Orim: Enemy ships approaching! Prepare for attack!
Orim: The boats will collide shortly! Be careful not to fall into the sea!
Orim: What? ! Captain Drake's ship! Watch out! He's tough!
Orim: Now a ghost ship! You don't even have time to breathe!
Orim: Watch out! I feel the chi of this ship is stronger than the others.
Orim: If the boats collide with each other, the enemy will jump in! Watch out!
Orim: Uuuu...I can feel Aldin's spirit from this ship!
Orim: The enemy is breaking in! Prepare for attack!
Orim: Ugh! Angry marine life is pouring in!
Orim: It's a portal leading to the inside of the enemy ship! Be careful. You can feel strong qi from inside.
Orim: Join the fight. You must annihilate the enemy forces or you will not survive!
Orim: The enemy has broken in and is trying to destroy our ship! Hurry up and take them down!
Orim: The ship is sinking! Please hurry and get out! It is dangerous in this condition!
1st unit broke in.
2nd unit broke in.
3rd wave has invaded.
4th wave has invaded.
Aldin
Orim... why did you let go of my hand... why did you run away alone without me...
Orim... let's go home together... I don't want to be away from you anymore...
Orim! Don't you like me anymore? Are you abandoning me?
Orim, you traitor! You thought you could escape alone!
His desire is completed by you...
Come on, this way... we're not done playing pranks on you...
Orim... Orim...
Orim, you are a pain in the ass. If you sin, you will be punished.
Surprised? That One has set me free again! Huhahaha! It's time for revenge!
Sea Harpy
Sea Drake
Orim: I don't need to explain this or that any longer...
Orim: By now, the Talking Island will have been reduced to ruins by their hands.
Orim: When I returned, all my memories would have disappeared without a trace...
Orim: The battle has just begun. I will meet with my elders and try to find a way to end this fight.
Orim: Everyone, please survive. Until this battle is over...
Orim: We are almost in Gludin territory! We must warn the people of this danger soon!
Orim: There are only a few left. Hang in there a little longer!
Aldin: That's about it... I guess this ship is mine.
Orim: The ship is about to sink. We must defend the ship somehow!
Orim: I can feel your chi stronger than before! Be careful!
Orim: I feel weaker than before. But watch out!

Is that Gadria there?
Or is it the Wicked Witch?
Is the reason my body is so heavy and my blades so sharp is because I'm dreaming!
You guys! You get to see Jim in your dreams! You should be honored!
Does your world, where you dream of me, have anything called peace?
Everyone says they are righteous! Then what will be the final justice!
Gadria! Appear before me! Don't make me wait any longer!
Gadria! Who told you to ride a horse with that precious body! You fool!
Gadria! Let's go home now to the family you're waiting for!

Human. Take her behind the wall. All because of my unstable mind...
Give the Queen the power to heal!
The power of the bitter cold for the queen!
You can't interfere with the Queen's chaos!
Can you withstand the power of the cold even though you're human?!

What are you doing disguised as believers? You still can't make sense of it!
Uh-oh! It's not my fault. Where the hell did the Church Master go at a time like this?
Aaahhh! Please help me!
You guys can't help yourselves when it comes to knowing the power of witchcraft: ......
Do you still not understand that the spirit of the world revolves around me!
Uh-oh! Just a little more, just a little more time for me!
Ah... so this is how it ends...
Thank you so much for attending my wedding.
Shh! Quiet. She might cry. ......
I just did what I was told...ta...ta...help me ......
Can you guys understand my pain so far?
I've come to know the power of new spells...
He was able to harness the power of witchcraft to keep people close to him...
When the year of the Black Dragon arrived and I spoke a little about the engery of Halpas, people did not doubt, but on the contrary began to believe...
The religion of Harpathism has been a good tool...ughahahahaha.
You want me to give up such wonderful power!
Never, never give up!
Bayliss was just about to let the world know about this...that's why I kidnapped him...
Summons of the Faithful
I dressed as a man and pretended to be an aide in order to watch the investigative process.
How do you feel about not noticing me beside you?
I will only acknowledge the ability of the undercover team to get this far.
This is it! There is no one who can stop me!

Those who shouted the Hero command! ?
You think you are heroes!
I would never fall down!
Do you just listen to the heroes' command?
There is no such thing as magical mercy for you!
Vortex of chaos, rage!
Do you think you can become a Hero just by shouting a Hero command?
Let's put shackles on both hands!
Your hands will twist and your whole body will rip!
Death to those who shouted the order!
Die, slaves!
Slaves who can't control themselves!

Sandworm!! I am afraid... that you have destroyed our resting place... and I will not allow you to do so!
Hey there, human! Have you ever seen a sandworm?
What's the point of asking a human being?
Of course not! A cowardly human being would die as soon as he saw the sandworms!
Humans are not the problem now. Ignore the humans and look for the sandworms!

In a few minutes, the show will begin.  The venue manager is handing out props to cheer with, so please use them!
In 60s the show will begin.
Everyone, World Star Psy has appeared.  Please welcome him with applause.
Hello Everyone!.. Singer Psy.
You are the Champion of this country! Everyone screaming~!!
I'm completely a fan~ Fan runs!
What style is Brother~? Brother Gangnam Style~! Everyone screaming~!!
Heh heh, bro, wait a minute!
Psy Brother ~ It's a gift~ If you wear this shoe, you can perform more exciting~!
Wow ~ Girl fan! Thank you for the gift~!
Oh, why are you doing this? Your feet are moving nicely~!
Humans~ If it's free, I can't use four people~
It's time for your friends to come. I'm 20,000~
Gentlemen, help me. My feet are tied and I can't move.
Ershabe has spawned..
Sandworm has spawned..
Attack of the Red Knight
What, these lively guys!
What a pity, I'm going to hurt my nose if I take my fans lightly!
Gentlemen, just a little more power! We need to kick him out quickly and start performing~
Ah, the show can't even start and end like this...
My legs are getting paralyzed, I can't stand it any longer...
Who is it! Those who torment our Psy oppa!
Brother! Be strong~ I'll come and help you soon~
My stamina is dropping. It's a big deal!
Everyone, please help me!
I need my strength to save Psy!
Is this Psy's concert hall? Looks like you've come to the right place.
You still can't deal with these scumbags. Did I pick an opponent that was too easy?
As you can see, you don't need to put a lot of effort into it. It's going to be a boring fight.
I'm on a different level than the guys I've been flirting with, so be prepared.
If there are less than 10 people, the performance will be cancelled.
Thank you so much~ If it wasn't for you, it would have been really bad. As a token of appreciation, I prepared a small gift, so please accept it.
Defeated all the bad guys. Please wait a moment for the Medal of Victory to be awarded.
Since the venue is very messy, the performance will start again after tidying up the venue.
You did a really good job. Goodbye back.
Psy has fallen. Please wait for a while until the medal of ordeal is awarded.
We will resume the performance as soon as Psy recovers.
We need stability, so everyone please stop and go back.
The defense was successful.
The fence blocking the road has been removed. Please go both ways.
Soon the monsters will start attacking. Put on your light stick and get ready for battle.
hey! Where are you going? You are not there!

This performance was canceled due to insufficient number of people.
I'll see you at the next show. Goodbye.
The mission failed because the time limit was exceeded. Please wait for a minute until the medal of ordeal is awarded.
It seems that it will be difficult to defeat all the enemies that rushing in.
I'm going to take Psy with me and take refuge first, you do the same, get away quickly.
The battle takes 15 minutes, and the mission will fail if the timeout is exceeded or Psy cannot be protected.
10 minutes left until the end of the battle.
5 minutes left until the end of the battle.
1 minute left until the end of the battle.

Confidant of Baphomet
We must break the curse of Master Baphomet...
For the owners of great magical powers...
I cannot reveal my true identity to the likes of you.
You stand against me with this level of competence!
How dare Gunther's disciples turn against him?
I give you a taste of the power of madness!
I will send you all to hell!
The Necromancer has spawned..
Death Knight has spawned..

So much for.........
Time to wake up from the illusion...
Damn... you gave me a mortal wound...
If it were just a little deeper...
Kukuku...while you sleep, you will be my slave and wander...hahahahaha!
How can a human being have this much power...?
Gghh...this curse...is this your last desperate attempt?
Kukuku... my curse will haunt you until the moment your desire is gone... hahahahaha!
The sword was cursed by the blood of Valakas, but it should retain some of its original power...
We're going to use the power of that sword to get out of here.
Maybe it's the curse, but when I use the sword, my past battles with Valakas and myself rarely come to the surface...
Maybe you can watch the fight too. Now go...I can't take much more of this.
The spirit of the Death Knight flows in. (Time remaining: 30 minutes)
You feel the will of the Death Knight. (Time remaining: 20 minutes)
The sword burns up violently.(Time Left: 10min)
The power of the sword begins to be suppressed.(Time Left: 5min)
You feel that there is not much time left.(Time Left: 3min)
You start to lose consciousness.(Time Left: 1min)
Master Valakas will show no mercy to you.
Under the curse of Master Valakas, you will continue to wander this world until you die.

Destroy... everything... everything...
Who are you?
I...I...I am...a knight...yes, I was a knight... Why are you here?
Knight?
That's right...I'm a knight...a foolish knight who overestimated his power and challenged Valakas...
Were you defeated by Valakas?
Defeated...yes...I am defeated. My memory and consciousness... are slowly fading...
Take this sword and get out of here before I completely lose my reason.
Valakas: Who woke me up?
Death Knight: Valakas! You finally showed up...
Valakas: The price for disturbing my sleep... be my slave and pay it till death...
Death Knight: Hmmm, I'll let you say those words after you defeat me.
Valakas: Kukuku... you have a lot of confidence...
Valakas: Die! Human!
If you never leave...
You cheeky little... follow me!
Let's use even more force to subdue them!
Face the greater forces of fire in the cave!

We've always been famous
This year will be the same, but next year will be different.
I missed a lot of games this year due to injuries.
Next year, we will steadily build up the number of wins.
We will always lead as rivals~
I won't be able to see you this fall, but I'll definitely rise to the top next year!!
Although it is said that we are not at the 2014 autumn party~
Next year we will definitely participate!
I don't know how long it will be without us in the fall.
Next year, I will definitely show you the face of an autumn emperor!!
But at the end of the day, I showed you what
You can't stop the reckless march of the dinosaurs...
Ugh!~ As the rumors say, it's a powerful dinosaur!
As much as you beat me and climbed up, I want you to rise to the top spot.
Oh no.. how??
A 2-year-old dinosaur has this kind of power...

Orim: First of all, please calm down. We must protect the ship.
Orim: The person attacking our ship is named Aldin.
Orim: We'll talk more about that later!
Orim: It would take at least three people to deal with Aldin. Oh, and if the boat leaves the shore, the enemy will attack. Watch out!
Orim: The enemy are breaking in! Prepare for attack!
Orim: I sense a strange spirit... be careful!
Orim: The enemy are gathering. Watch out!
Orim: The enemy are gathering. Hang in there a little longer!
Orim: Aldin is getting closer! Please be careful!
Orim: I don't need to explain this or that any longer...
Orim: By now, the Talking Island will have been reduced to ruins by their hands.
Orim: When we returned, all our memories would have vanished without a trace...
Orim: The battle has just begun. I will meet with my master and try to find a way to end this fight.
Orim: Until the day this battle is over...
Orim: We must tell everyone about this crisis!
Orim: There is nothing we can do with this force. Run away!
Orim: This is not going to be enough to fight Aldin.
Orim: Get people together and come back!
Orim: I'll wait here...
Aldin: That's it... This ship belongs to me.
Orim: The enemy has retreated. It looks like we can take a little break.
Enemy ship damaged and retreated.
Orim: I feel Aldin's spirit!

The defense of this gift supply route has been canceled due to insufficient players.
Please participate in the defense of the following gift supply routes.
The defense failed because the time limit was exceeded. Please wait a moment for the burnt out gift box to be delivered.
It seems that it is not enough to kill monsters.
I'll take Elder Santa Claus to evacuate first, so you too, take shelter quickly.
The battle lasts 15 minutes, and the mission will fail if the time limit is exceeded or if Santa Claus fails to protect the Elder.

Water Orbs, Healing Orbs, Teleport Orbs, and Dimensional Fragments are removed when returning to the original world.
Water balls only damage characters in other worlds adjacent to the ball.
The ball of recovery restores the HP and MP of allied world characters adjacent to the ball.
The teleportation ball teleports characters from allied worlds adjacent to the ball into the interior of the pyramid.
Destroy the Osiris Control Stone inside the Pyramid to begin the full-scale Siege of Theberas.
Experience and items will not be lost if a player dies in the Theberus siege.
When the game restarts or ends, the game returns to the original world.
Winning the Theberus siege will provide 30 minutes of additional hunting time to progress in the defeat of the ancient gods.
Collecting 5,000 or more Dimensional Fragments will earn you a victory/defeat reward.
Successful PK'ing of players from other worlds earns a portion of the Dimensional Fragments for the deceased player.
Every three minutes after the Osiris domination stone is destroyed, one domination stone of the world that has gathered the most members in the central region inside the pyramid is activated.
The first world to activate 3 domination stones in each world wins.
Worlds that lose the siege of Theberus will be forced to teleport to their original world.
Press the "&" key for general chat and the "^" key for world-specific chat.
If the number of active domination stones at the end of the Theberus siege is the same, the world with the higher points wins.
You can also move inside the pyramid by going through the pyramid basement.
Inside the pyramid, the curse of Osiris has been placed on the pyramid, causing a significant reduction in HP.
World Point and dominant stone activation information is available in the Theberus UI.
The Osiris curse can be lifted by collecting world points.

Pity you are coming here...
It's going to be hard to make it back alive.

Battle Trader^Theon
The match starts 60 seconds after entry. You can start quickly if all players press the "Prepare" button at the bottom right. 
You can purchase items needed for battle from Theon.
If you purchase class package items, you can quickly set consumables. Items you don't need can be purchased from the Battle Merchant.
You can enter the Colosseum with only equipment items and Magic Dolls, except invisibility cloaks.
If you do not win within the time limit, the win/loss will be divided according to the number of deaths and attack points, and the draw will be handled when everything is the same.
Only 2 Colosseum coins will be paid at the start of the game, and various consumables can be purchased from NPC Theon.
During the match, an exlusive Colosseum shortcut slot is added, so you can use Coloseeum exclusive items in those slots.
At the end of the season, your stats may be reset.
Cheering messages can be seen by both players and spectators.

Get off me right now!
The whole world shall be smouldered by death!
Nothing excites me more than red blood, chuckling..
Moron.. who dares steps in front of me!
I'll share the pain I've suffered with you too.
You're challenging me.. Let me make you feel that foolishness!
Don't think this is the end!
I will watch your deaths with my own eyes..!
This is how you're going to get die..
Don't promise next time! ha ha ha
Wait for you at the threshold of death!
My body may fall, but I will wake up again!

It's not over yet...
Who killed me....
I baked it all white....
You're next.
The king's desires should never be satisfied....
Defend the Temple of the Reaper!
There are signs of humans....
Believe me! ...You don't believe me?
Become a dead man and follow me...
Come on, come on, come on...!
Shooting star... the game is about to start...
Dripping?? dripping??.
I can feel the human breath...
I feel the cold air of human....
Feel the warmth of human....

Glory to the shadow of the flame...
We shall rise again with the power of Master Yahi!
Gruul... I have not yet...
I don't fear death...
My anger will never subside!
Still... not strong enough...
You know nothing...
I never thought I would suffer such humiliation...
Grrr.. everything will be as I want it to be!
So much for...?
Someday I will show you... what I see!
I can finally rest in peace...................................
Helvain will judge you all!
I will follow in his footsteps...
I'm sorry...Lia
Was this the extent of my ability?
Even if I fall my will will not yield.
Ba...I believe in Master Barranca...
When Master Slave arrives your fate will be sealed.

Visit all for Master Dantes!
It's about time I showed you what I can do!
Master Balod made the right choice!
Do you know what suffering in hell is?
Now go away...
Let's put you through this pain too...
The greater the pain, the greater the joy...
Let's bring all to their death!
You think you can stop me!?
It is the bright red blood that brings me to the peak of excitement...hohoho
Inflict on me even deeper pain!
I envy you guys who can feel pain...
Try harder... harder to contort your face...
The stench of decay wafts from your souls as well...
The more depraved a soul is, the more it cannot escape the sweet smell of the devil.
Selfishness divides you! Kuh-ha-ha!
What do you think? How do you feel the power you're experiencing for the first time?
It is better to give up hope in vain.
Your prophecies are but a mirage.
Ufff... don't leave anything behind.
Let me show you the power of darkness.
I will watch you die with my own eyes!
Ugh...I remember that one...ugh...
My faith is not misplaced.
My frozen heart...

Grrr~! Someday I will tear humans to pieces.
Guaaaahhh...
Damn, that sucks...
Let Master Peacock tear you to pieces.
Gooooo...
You...
See you again on a bright moonlit night, heh.
Goh... goh...
Guaaaahhh...
Finally, they're going to let us go...
My grudge is not over yet...
Blood calls for blood...
We've got to get him!
Ummm...
Damn...
It died once. I won't die again...
Kookkook. Baphomet will bury you all.
Tsk!

Gghhhh...
Don't let any of them leave alive...
Stop him...
I didn't know there was such a powerful thing...
I will bring this fact to the attention of the vice captain...
Cold floor...
Do not inform them of my death...
Please do not...
We can't just give in like this.
Mr. Kurtz I am sorry...
My weapons are made of silver, so they're good for hunting!
Shhhh!
Oh my gosh!
When Mr. Kurtz arrives, everything will be resolved.
They're the little ones, huh?
Come on, ordinary people!
All those muscles. Cool, right?
Hmm... There's a strange smell of the Red Knight coming from somewhere...
I'd like to finish it quickly and get out of here.
Oh my gosh!
Help me!

Welcome, my dear, I see you've received my wedding present.
Let's give them a big firework display worthy of a gorgeous ceremony!
I hope you die!
I did receive your gift, Unura!
I don't feel anything. It's over!
Are you trying to interfere with my ceremony?
You humble people... I am the Queen!
Come out and greet your guests, servants!
Uhhh... my wedding... King...please take care of me...
Kiah... my wedding... It's Evoltine...
Grrrrr... intruder found... eliminate.
Guru Ruru... Guru... Less... Mabu!
Gurururu... Kill... Guru... Aima...!
Guru... Leslene... Legdov...!
Gurururu... I can't escape...
Grrrr... if you resist, I will kill you... all of you!
Guru... offerings... will not be missed...
Guru... summon the watcher...
Guru... intruder... failed to eliminate...
If only... if only... if only... if only Bard's... if only he had an eye left over...
The noise is probably due to the uninvited guests...
You better not irritate me. Unless you want to be preyed upon!
You brought this on yourselves... burn it down!
I will drink all your blood!
You're so bloody arrogant!
I haven't had enough yet, take more!
Don't resist in vain. Quietly offer your blood and soul!
Show yourselves, my minions!
Not enough blood... my blood... kuuuuuuh.
Coo... my throat is burning... if only I could get rid of this dryness!
All who live in this land... shall be exterminated!
Take it... all die!
I will kill the living... and bury them!
A fresh body...I'll curse you...Rotten!
Kill... Tear... Decorate... Happy...
With such a powerless body you cannot defeat me...
Flesh...must be maintained.... The body... the corpse... the dead flesh...
Blood makes me...excited! !
Ugh... my body... will be destroyed... by those stupid guys...
Ugh...Curse the living...I can't control my anger...If only I had Bardo's right arm...
Gurururu... The fearless ones have stepped into my territory...
Taste my wrath with your body!
Gwah! Don't think you can escape!
I'll tear you to pieces!
The little bastards are getting cocky!
This is my territory... I'll never let you through!
Grun...I can't take it anymore...I'm going to choke the life out of you right now!
Guru... guru...
Gurururu...I won't admit it...I'm sure this wound will heal!
Gurururu...it's a good idea to run away...before this wound heals!
Do the perishables dare to challenge me, the Eternal?
Your death is imminent.
This is ancient power!
The power of the desert, I wonder if I can withstand it...
Cheeky...I am the ancient king!
It works... how would you like to be my servant?
Reaper, release my sealed power!
Behold this overflowing power!
It's a shame... if only I could regain my true strength, I would trample you all!
Reaper! If only I had my strength back I wouldn't be in such humiliation...
Hohoho, looks like a good toy has arrived.
Come on, give me a present!
Be quiet...it's hard to play with you.
Hohohoho...would you like to try this?
I think I've been bitten by a mosquito...I'll make it prettier for you.
Hahahaha, this is fun...you'll enjoy it!
Let's see, you'll have to entertain me some more!
Better to play with everyone than alone, right? Ohohoho.
Ha... empty... but it was fun. Bye...
Aaah... too bad... would have loved to play with you more...
...the time has come...
The door of death opens...
The ancient power has been divided...
Now you're ready for the sacrifice...

You're here...which...let's see what you can do.
I'll set the example, take it!
Fearless, this is how a battle is fought!
I can't watch this, let's get this over with here!
Are you kidding me? You better come at me straight!
Nonsense. I can't believe you thought you could beat me at this level.
Sweet. You're wasting my time!
My power is limitless!
Kk, it doesn't look too bad.... I wish you good luck to the end.
As good as this one is, it seems worth a bet....please.
A barbaric act... to challenge the greatest emperor in the land...
Die, for this is the power of the great king!
You cannot hurt me!
Taste the power of destruction and ruin!
I'm so sick to my stomach. You are the most soft-hearted people I've ever met.
It's Ok. Struggle some more!
You have the nerve to stand against an immortal being!
Dark magic, forever!
I shall not die... as long as there is a tower... I am eternal!
I will not allow it... for I am the eternal and immortal King!
Did you come here to be an offering?
You arrogant overconfidence in your own power, may you be punished!
You immature people who don't know your place, you will be punished!
You irreverent ones who try to challenge God on your own, may you suffer damnation!
That's about it... have you run out of steam?
I will only praise your courage. Otherwise, it wouldn't even have value as an offering.
Not bad for an insignificant lowly creature.
Let's take the thunder of wrath!
Whenever and whoever you are... we are watching you...
We'll see how long that arrogance lasts...
Violent Reaper Soul: You are a tough soul to have come this far.
Give me your soul... and I will put it to good use.
I like the most music.
I send you painless... offerings...
You want to meet the real Grim Reaper!
That will not be enough to open the door. Put all your energy into it.
It is approaching...the glorious moment when Unura will become an offering.
Guo... guaah!
O you who live...die.
Violent Reaper Soul: This completes the tyrannical force.
Wicked Reaper Soul: Kukuku...it will be a good offering.
Let us dedicate every last drop of our souls to it.
This will be your graveyard.
Struggle to your death.
You're going to meet the Grim Reaper anyway. It would be better to meet him in death.
That won't open the door. Pour more soul into it.
Keep it up. Wield your strength... kukuk...
Kuh... uu... kuh...
Death... approaches...
Wicked Reaper Soul: Finally, the time has come for the completion of the wicked power...kuhuhuhuhu.
Those who are to be the offerings of the tower have stepped into it themselves.
Arrogant ones, I will retrieve your souls!
Taste the infinite power of an immortal being!
This is the last time. Be a offering to the tower!
You are a dishonest person who is supposed to be an offering!
Kukk... you still can't give up, hoping that you can win!
You little children, no matter how hard you try, the result will be the same!
Bury yourselves here, you arrogant ones!
Consider yourself lucky this time... unless you can let go of your arrogance, that day will come again...
Wait and see... when you die, you will meet me again anyway... and I will take your soul then.
Talking Island is ours!

Whoops. You sound like Merry Christmas.
I hate hot ovens! I don't like it!
Hail or pour down!
ugh I wish I had a pretty cake buddy too.

A group of cursed people rushes in.
Prepare for the next attack.
The curse is getting stronger.
The final dark band is closing in.
Block all attacks.
Whoa! A monster!
Protect the crystal ball in the center.
If the time runs out or the crystal ball is destroyed, you fail.
Orim will lend you a little help.
Cursed fog causes severe pollution damage.
A cursed spirit is approaching.
Go to the teleportation magic circle generated in front of Orim.
Now you are back in your world.
The party has been destroyed.
The space-time travel ends.
Please try again next time.
Ah... the crystal ball has been destroyed...
The space-time travel ends.
Please try again next time.
You succeeded in helping Orim.
Soon the space-time travel will come to an end.
May the blessings of Einhasad be upon your future...
Orim's tears... calm the wall of fire...
On the other side of the wall are the wretched priests who summon curses.
"Semar"...I'm sorry...
The summoning of flame monsters has stopped.
Melchior...just wait a little longer...
The summoning of monsters in the deep sea has stopped.
Balthazar will put you out of your misery...
The summoning of the wind-wave monster has stopped.
Kasper...you should know the truth...
The summoning of earth monsters has stopped.

Master Rosas won't let you live!
Ughhhh...I'm coming back again.
You have offended me... and the One will not forgive you!
Go to the lighthouse at the far east end. From there you can reach the underground canal.
The end of the waterway is connected to Crocodile Island.
I won't stop you if you insist, but... be careful.
You want to go to a place that even we have stayed away from for decades.
This is the place where the crocodile king Rosas, who has become a monster, is sealed up.
May God bless you...
Soon the monsters will be pouring in.
Be prepared.
Ah...I've lost you too.
Go back to your world and have a good rest.
Thank you for your efforts. Thanks to you, there will be peace for a while.
Now, go back to your world.

I thought the odds of losing to you were less than 10%, but it seems I was wrong.
I've been waiting for you for two days. At last we meet.
You...! We have met on the third floor of the TOI!
It's frustrating to be killed by your sword that doesn't even have a 4th stage attribute enhancement! !
All you get for killing me is five teleportation scrolls.
I see you are happy to get your +6 sword. Sounds like you in the past...
You jumped on me just because I was wearing +7 Knights' armor. This is what it means to be a frog in a well.
Come on, all 8 of you together. You think you can beat me!
To try to defeat me with a +9 Knights Dagger....I am dumbfounded.
They say a +10 Sword is without mercy. But you don't deserve even that kind of mercy.
Go to 11th Street and strengthen your equipment before you go.
Get the hell out of here before midnight!
It was you who took the elixir from me 13 years ago!
14 years from now, you will still be here, unchanged.
15 billion spent will be wasted, and that's what we have here. Keep that in mind and listen up!
Do you think you can hold me back from mastering the hexadecimal system?
You have only a 17% chance of getting out of here in one piece.
18...
When I first met you, you were a 19 year old boy. You've grown up while I haven't seen you for a while, hahaha.
Don't turn away, look hard, you've endured 20 years for this moment!
Twenty-one years. I've waited 21 years to see you like this again.
22...I will give you 22 seconds of my time.
It's already 23:00. This is the end of my time playing with you.
You have not grown up after 24 hours.
Looking at your useless body, you're not even CON25.
You have a 26% chance of getting an audience with me.
Your ER doesn't seem to reach 27. Not even one of my arrows can be dodged.
There are already more than 280,000 people who gave their lives to me...
You're the 290,000th person to give me your soul!
Remember when level 30 was the chat level!
Listen carefully. 31 seconds later you will regret not running away.
Go quickly. To challenge me with a sword that does less than 32 damage...
As long as the 33 spirits follow me, this place will not collapse.
Nothing like the miracle on 34th Street...
What have you been up to since you stole 35 elixirs from me?
Hahaha. Thirty-six measures are better than running away. This is your last chance!
Close your eyes. Do you see it? This is what will happen to you in the future, 37 years from now.
The odds of you beating me are one in 380,000.
If I were to buy your soul, the estimate would be roughly...39 adena?
How can you be 40 years old and in your infirm years and still be lost? It's laughable.
You were a young man in your youth, and now you are already 41 years old... The passage of time is truly merciless.
Everyone gets along well and in 42 seconds you'll be in the afterlife!
The password is 43... Now it's time to get stronger!
Tsk tsk....you think you can challenge me with a hit that's not even 44!
Ugh... to be beaten by a mere 45 damage...

The Ant Queen's hiding place has been discovered! Come, we'll take you to the entrance!
It's a catastrophe... the confusion continues that we can't recognize each other.
Will trust be maintained in the midst of chaos? Now the ugly mind of man will be revealed.
Ant Queen's will is activated. Be prepared for a change of vigilance.
Ant Queen's will was pierced. His vigilance changed.
I'll make you feel the fear of death, you puny humans! !
Is this the extent of your strength!? !
Go ahead and cry your eyes out in misery.
Interesting! Really interesting! !
You can't run away from me. Let me have my fun!
Do not fear death!
Kuuuu...I'm so frustrated...if my body hadn't been injured...
To those who oppose me! There is only death!
I'm gonna burn it all down! Uhhahaha!
Come, my creatures!
Let those wretches be afraid!

I want to get out of this endless nightmare. Please help me!
Aah! My body won't listen to me!
Haa...has the end finally come...
This is your last chance. If you want to run, now is the time.
Do you hear it? The sound of your soul being swallowed by a nightmare!
They would rather make you beg them to kill you.
Welcome to a nightmare you can't get out of.
Who is the scary thing that woke me up? You guys!
Pfft, I will be stuck in this nightmare forever!
Oh, my God! You have to endure this!
Ummm, now this is going to hurt just a little bit!
Don't avoid it.  It's an arrow that contains my heart.
Have you already fallend for me? That's weird.
Excellent. It has enough charm to catch my eye.
Haha. I feel like this...you're the first.

Looks like all those stupid keepers are gone...
I beat the keeper and he still surrounds me...
Seems like these light barrier don't go away easily...
You'll never get to me at this rate... move faster!
Free me from this troublesome barrier as soon as possible!
Almost... almost...
I hope that with my power... we can break this ward...!
Looks like we're almost there...
How I have longed for this moment...
My magic is more powerful now that I've been sealed up!
I will turn this coliseum into your graveyard...
I am the ruler of Aden World...
Not a vessel to be sealed in this coliseum!
Seems we don't have much time...
It seems the barrier of light wasn't completely broken...
Slowly... slowly... you're surrounding me again...

The game is over. Forced return to town after 10 seconds.
You found a good snowman! There are four left.
Two! There are three good snowmen left.
You already found three good snowmen! There are only two left.

You found all the good snowmen! Thank you for watching over Christmas.
