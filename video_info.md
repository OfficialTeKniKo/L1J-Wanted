# Videos to see (and to learn) how Lineage it works lineage right now

Videos extracted from the seller of Lineage Server. Is possible to extract a lot of very ussefull info

## Different things

In this video he used a diamond a few times (consume). 
I think that is related to get more exp. We need to study this, i mean, the exp thing
becouse if is free to play, you dont get exp if you dont pay...

Also in this video, when he is in TI near a npc, seems that he writes a command
and he get a list of items. Maybe there is a command where you can get all
the items that an npc sells. This is very ussefull.

## Einhasad Blessing / Protection. 

I don't know if are different things and the difference between Protection and Blessing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnxXs4lGzhE

In lineage powerbook says: 
If you hunt monsters with the Blessing of Einhasad buff, you will gain more experience than usual and the chance of acquiring items will increase.

So, at the end, if you dont have this, you will get 0% exp and posibly no items. 
Is possible to "recharge" this effect with Dragon Diamond and Fine Dragon Diamond

Also is possible to recharge this when killing bosses like Balrog or Green Reaper or killing Sand Worms

https://lineage.plaync.com/powerbook/wiki/%EC%83%8C%EB%93%9C+%EC%9B%9C

and also when you participate in different Events. In the left side, where quest area, if we have something with the small purple icon is becouse
if we get it, we can recharge the Einhasad Blessing.

When you apply this effect, you get or 7 days or 30 days of Blessing. Real time, so, it does not matter if you play or not.

The efficience about consuming the Einhasad Blessing can be "altered" leveling up (more level, more efficience) and using items

https://lineage.plaync.com/powerbook/wiki/%EC%B6%95%EB%B3%B5+%EC%86%8C%EB%AA%A8+%ED%9A%A8%EC%9C%A8

The ammount of EXP with the Blessing can be increased with different items:
